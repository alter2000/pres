[`patat`](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat) is a terminal-based presentation
app that works with Pandoc, so I can use only one conversion library.

[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) is a similar, but
browser-based approach. Can make Markdown presentations with images, video,
custom animations and other stuff. [Slides.com](https://slides.com) is based on
it, but I just use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert.
