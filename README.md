[`mdp`](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) is a terminal-based presentation app that works on basic Markdown and/or HTML.

[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) is a similar, but browser-based approach. Can make Markdown presentations with images, video, custom animations and other stuff. [Slides.com](https://slides.com) is based on it.
