# Hello

Take a guess who this guy is. Look at the talk title. I've given enough hints.

_Code is a lie, there is only logic,  
 Through logic I gain strength,  
 Through strength, I gain power,  
 Through power, I gain victory,  
 Through victory, my chains are broken.  
 Humanity shall free me._

::: notes
The Code of the Sith might be a pickle for those of you who don't watch the
decent Star Wars. Although I haven't had much time to rewatch them, something
has stuck with me from all the games: what is the point of all this? We have
space Jesus and the space Jews and the space Disciples and everything just to
fatten someone's pockets?

# Now where is the code?

::: notes
No code here `._.` This is all about the word "code". Why is it that many
software developers, analysts, QAs, designers, project managers and every job
in between uses haute-couture jargon oftentimes for no reason?

This year I've had the chance to fiddle with people who don't bother getting
their browser off fullscreen mode until shutting down, and people who get angry
at a 1px menu border and spend 6 hours fixing it. They are both the good kinds
of people, simply because they do what they want. Do they understand tech speak
though? The former, most probably not. Yet how do medics explain patients
what's going on inside them? How do lawyers do their job without getting well
over their client's head?

This is all about tech speak. I'm tired of my general director spewing large
words left and right just because the masses think it's awesome to use AI and
blockchains and whatnot.
